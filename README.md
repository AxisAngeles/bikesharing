<br> Using the city-bike data, we first show the most popular starting locations for each trip.

<br> Next, we need to highlight that our main market will be male users. 
* **Bike's usage per hour:**<br>
![Story3](https://github.com/AxisAngeles/bikesharing/blob/main/Challenge/Resources/Story3.PNG)
<br> It's also worh mentioning that almost no trip will exceed the 30 minutes of duration. 
* **Bike's usage per hour and gender:**<br>
Followed up by a similar view by gender. 
* **Rush hours:**<br>
![Story4](https://github.com/AxisAngeles/bikesharing/blob/main/Challenge/Resources/Story4.PNG)
<br> Finally, our story will show the rush hours by Day of Week, where our investors will see a huge difference between working days and weekends. 
* **Rush hours by Gender:**<br>
This will also be splitted by gender and user type.

### **Summary**
After reviewing the whole story, we expect to show to the possible investors that not only there's a high demand for the _Bikesharing_ business, but also, we'll be able to demonstrate a well prepared opperational and branding action plan based on our demoghraphics and rush hours analysis.

This is why, we **recommend the following views** for our story:
* Week day and Rush hour analysis by age:
There's an obvious difference between male customers probably correlated to job situations. An Age analysis would allow us to help if _Bikesharing_ has a potential market for children or retired people.
* User Type locaion data:
It's important to analyze if Non-subscribers are using the _Bikesharing_ services in different locations than those with subscription; this will allow us to make up some additions campaigns to our business plan.
